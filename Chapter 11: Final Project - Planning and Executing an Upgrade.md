# **Chapter 11: Final Project - Planning and Executing an Upgrade**

---

## **11.1 Overview of the Final Project**

The final project is designed to consolidate the knowledge gained throughout the book by planning and executing an upgrade or migration from an older Oracle version to a newer version. This project will involve:
1. **Creating an Upgrade Plan Document.**
2. **Developing Migration Scripts and Logs.**
3. **Generating a Post-Upgrade Performance Report.**

The project will simulate a real-world scenario, providing hands-on experience with the tools and techniques discussed in previous chapters.

## **11.2 Project Scenario**

### **11.2.1 Scenario Description**
- **Source Database:** Oracle 11g.
- **Target Database:** Oracle 19c.
- **Objective:** Upgrade the database to take advantage of new features and ensure long-term support.
- **Constraints:**
  - Limited downtime window (4 hours).
  - Ensure application compatibility post-upgrade.
  - Validate performance improvements.

## **11.3 Step-by-Step Guide**

### **11.3.1 Step 1: Pre-Upgrade Planning**
1. **Assess the Current Environment:**
   - Review the existing database schema, applications, and dependencies.
   - Identify deprecated features and plan for replacements.

2. **Run the Pre-Upgrade Information Tool:**
   ```sql
   @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/preupgrd.sql
   ```
   - Review the pre-upgrade report and address any issues.

3. **Create a Backup:**
   - Perform a full backup of the database:
     ```sql
     RMAN> BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
     ```

### **11.3.2 Step 2: Upgrade Strategy**
1. **Choose the Upgrade Path:**
   - Direct upgrade from Oracle 11g to Oracle 19c is supported.
   - Ensure all pre-upgrade checks are completed.

2. **Prepare the Target Environment:**
   - Install Oracle 19c on the target server.
   - Configure the new Oracle Home.

### **11.3.3 Step 3: Execute the Upgrade**
1. **Start the Database in Upgrade Mode:**
   ```sql
   STARTUP UPGRADE;
   ```

2. **Run the Upgrade Scripts:**
   ```sql
   @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catupgrd.sql
   ```

3. **Restart the Database:**
   ```sql
   SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   STARTUP;
   ```

4. **Run the Post-Upgrade Scripts:**
   ```sql
   @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utlrp.sql
   ```

### **11.3.4 Step 4: Post-Upgrade Validation**
1. **Verify the Upgrade:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM v$version;
   ```

2. **Test Application Compatibility:**
   - Run application test cases to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
   - Address any issues identified during testing.

3. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Run performance benchmarks and compare them with pre-upgrade results.
   - Identify and address any performance regressions.

## **11.5 Best Practices**

### **11.5.1 Planning and Preparation**
- Conduct a thorough pre-upgrade assessment.
- Perform a test upgrade in a sandbox environment.
- Ensure all stakeholders are informed and aligned.

### **11.5.2 Execution**
- Follow the upgrade steps meticulously.
- Monitor the upgrade process closely.
- Document all actions and outcomes.

### **11.5.3 Post-Upgrade Validation**
- Test the application thoroughly to ensure compatibility.
- Validate performance improvements.
- Address any issues promptly.
