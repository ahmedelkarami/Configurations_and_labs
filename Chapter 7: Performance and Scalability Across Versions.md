## **7.1 Overview of Performance and Scalability**

Performance and scalability are critical aspects of Oracle Database administration. Over the years, Oracle has introduced numerous features to improve query performance, reduce latency, and scale databases to handle increasing workloads. This chapter explores the evolution of these features across Oracle Database versions, focusing on **query optimization**, **in-memory enhancements**, and **scalability features**.

## **7.2 Evolution of Query Optimization**

### **7.2.1 Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)**
- **Purpose:** Determines the most efficient execution plan for SQL queries.
- **Evolution:**
  - **Oracle 7:** Introduced the CBO as an alternative to the Rule-Based Optimizer (RBO).
  - **Oracle 10g:** Enhanced CBO with histograms and dynamic sampling.
  - **Oracle 12c:** Introduced Adaptive Query Optimization.
  - **Oracle 19c:** Added Real-Time Statistics and Automatic Indexing.

### **7.2.2 Adaptive Query Optimization**
- **Purpose:** Improves query performance by adapting execution plans based on runtime statistics.
- **Components:**
  - **Adaptive Plans:** Dynamically adjusts join methods and distribution methods during query execution.
  - **Adaptive Statistics:** Automatically gathers additional statistics for complex queries.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces the need for manual query tuning.
  - Ensures optimal performance for dynamic workloads.

### **7.2.3 SQL Plan Management (SPM)**
- **Purpose:** Ensures stable and predictable query performance by managing execution plans.
- **How It Works:**
  - Captures and stores execution plans in a SQL Plan Baseline.
  - Prevents plan regressions by using only verified plans.
- **Benefits:**
  - Protects against performance regressions caused by plan changes.
  - Simplifies plan management in complex environments.

## **7.3 In-Memory Enhancements**

### **7.3.1 In-Memory Column Store (Oracle 12c)**
- **Purpose:** Improves query performance for analytical workloads by storing data in memory in a columnar format.
- **How It Works:**
  - Data is stored in both row format (for OLTP) and column format (for analytics).
  - Queries on large datasets are significantly faster.
- **Benefits:**
  - Accelerates reporting and analytics.
  - Reduces the need for additional indexing.

### **7.3.2 In-Memory Aggregation (Oracle 19c)**
- **Purpose:** Improves performance for aggregate queries by storing precomputed results in memory.
- **How It Works:**
  - Aggregates are computed and stored in memory during data loading.
  - Queries retrieve precomputed results instead of recalculating aggregates.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces query execution time for aggregate queries.
  - Improves performance for data warehousing workloads.

### **7.3.3 In-Memory JSON (Oracle 21c)**
- **Purpose:** Enhances performance for JSON queries by storing JSON data in memory.
- **How It Works:**
  - JSON data is stored in a binary format in memory.
  - Supports fast querying and manipulation of JSON data.
- **Benefits:**
  - Improves performance for applications using JSON data.
  - Simplifies working with semi-structured data.

## **7.4 Scalability Features**

### **7.4.1 Real Application Clusters (RAC)**
- **Purpose:** Provides high availability and scalability by allowing multiple instances to access a single database.
- **How It Works:**
  - Instances run on different servers and share the same database files.
  - Provides load balancing and failover capabilities.
- **Benefits:**
  - Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
  - Scales horizontally to handle increasing workloads.

### **7.4.2 Sharding**
- **Purpose:** Improves scalability and performance by distributing data across multiple databases (shards).
- **How It Works:**
  - Data is partitioned and stored in separate shards.
  - Queries are routed to the appropriate shard based on the sharding key.
- **Benefits:**
  - Scales horizontally for large datasets and high transaction rates.
  - Improves performance by reducing contention.

### **7.4.3 Partitioning**
- **Purpose:** Improves performance and manageability by dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- **Types of Partitioning:**
  - **Range Partitioning:** Partitions data based on a range of values (e.g., dates).
  - **Hash Partitioning:** Distributes data evenly across partitions using a hash function.
  - **List Partitioning:** Partitions data based on a list of values (e.g., regions).
- **Benefits:**
  - Improves query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.
  - Simplifies data management and maintenance.

## **7.5 Hands-On: Configuring Real Application Clusters (RAC)**

### **7.5.1 Setting Up RAC**
1. **Install Oracle Grid Infrastructure:**
   - Install and configure Oracle Grid Infrastructure on all nodes in the cluster.

2. **Create a RAC Database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE rac_db
   USER SYS IDENTIFIED BY password
   USER SYSTEM IDENTIFIED BY password
   ENABLE PLUGGABLE DATABASE
   SEED FILE_NAME_CONVERT=('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/rac_db/pdbseed/', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/rac_db/pdb1/');
   ```

3. **Verify RAC Configuration:**
   ```sql
   SELECT instance_name, host_name, status
   FROM gv$instance;
   ```

### **7.5.2 Testing RAC**
1. **Run a Query on All Nodes:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date = '2023-01-01';
   ```

2. **Check Load Balancing:**
   ```sql
   SELECT inst_id, COUNT(*)
   FROM gv$session
   GROUP BY inst_id;
   ```

## **7.6 Hands-On: Implementing Sharding**

### **7.6.1 Setting Up Sharding**
1. **Create a Sharded Database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE SHARDED DATABASE shard_db
   USER SYS IDENTIFIED BY password
   USER SYSTEM IDENTIFIED BY password;
   ```

2. **Create Shards:**
   ```sql
   CREATE SHARD shard1
   DATABASE LINK shard1_link
   CONNECT TO shard1_user IDENTIFIED BY password;
   ```

3. **Verify Sharding Configuration:**
   ```sql
   SELECT shard_name, shard_type, status
   FROM dba_shards;
   ```

### **7.6.2 Testing Sharding**
1. **Insert Data into a Sharded Table:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, sale_date, amount)
   VALUES (1, SYSDATE, 1000);
   ```

2. **Query Data from a Shard:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_id = 1;
   ```
