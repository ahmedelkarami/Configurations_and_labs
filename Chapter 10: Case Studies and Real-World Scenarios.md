# **Chapter 10: Case Studies and Real-World Scenarios**

---

## **10.1 Overview of Case Studies**

Real-world scenarios provide valuable insights into the challenges and solutions encountered during database upgrades, migrations, and feature implementations. This chapter presents three case studies:
1. **Upgrading a Legacy System from Oracle 10g to Oracle 19c.**
2. **Implementing Multitenancy in Oracle 12c.**
3. **Leveraging JSON Relational Duality in Oracle 23c.**

Each case study includes a detailed analysis of the problem, the steps taken to address it, and the outcomes.

## **10.2 Case Study 1: Upgrading a Legacy System from Oracle 10g to Oracle 19c**

### **10.2.1 Scenario**
- **Problem:** A legacy application running on Oracle 10g needs to be upgraded to Oracle 19c to take advantage of new features and ensure long-term support.
- **Challenges:**
  - Compatibility issues with deprecated features.
  - Limited downtime window for the upgrade.
  - Ensuring application compatibility after the upgrade.

### **10.2.2 Solution**
1. **Pre-Upgrade Planning:**
   - Conduct a thorough assessment of the existing environment.
   - Identify deprecated features and plan for replacements.
   - Perform a test upgrade in a sandbox environment.

2. **Upgrade Strategy:**
   - Use an **incremental upgrade** approach:
     - Oracle 10g → Oracle 11g → Oracle 12c → Oracle 19c.
   - Perform each upgrade step in the sandbox environment to identify and resolve issues.

3. **Data Migration:**
   - Use **Oracle Data Pump** to export and import data between versions.
   - Validate data integrity after each migration step.

4. **Post-Upgrade Validation:**
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure compatibility.
   - Address any performance issues identified during testing.

### **10.2.3 Outcome**
- The upgrade was completed successfully within the downtime window.
- The application performed better on Oracle 19c, with improved query performance and stability.
- The organization benefited from long-term support and access to new features.

## **10.3 Case Study 2: Implementing Multitenancy in Oracle 12c**

### **10.3.1 Scenario**
- **Problem:** A company running multiple Oracle databases wants to consolidate them into a single container database (CDB) to reduce overhead and simplify management.
- **Challenges:**
  - Migrating existing databases to pluggable databases (PDBs).
  - Ensuring minimal downtime during the migration.
  - Managing resource allocation among PDBs.

### **10.3.2 Solution**
1. **Planning and Assessment:**
   - Evaluate the existing databases to identify candidates for consolidation.
   - Plan the migration sequence to minimize downtime.

2. **Creating the CDB:**
   - Create a new container database (CDB):
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE cdb1
     USER SYS IDENTIFIED BY password
     USER SYSTEM IDENTIFIED BY password
     ENABLE PLUGGABLE DATABASE
     SEED FILE_NAME_CONVERT=('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/cdb1/pdbseed/', '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/cdb1/pdb1/');
     ```

3. **Migrating Databases to PDBs:**
   - Use the **DBMS_PDB** package to create PDBs from existing databases:
     ```sql
     BEGIN
         DBMS_PDB.DESCRIBE('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/source_db/');
     END;
     ```
   - Plug the PDBs into the CDB:
     ```sql
     CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb1 USING '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/source_db/pdb1.xml';
     ```

4. **Post-Migration Tasks:**
   - Verify the PDBs:
     ```sql
     SELECT name, open_mode FROM v$pdbs;
     ```
   - Allocate resources using Resource Manager:
     ```sql
     CREATE RESOURCE PLAN my_plan;
     ```

### **10.3.3 Outcome**
- The databases were successfully consolidated into a single CDB.
- Resource management was simplified, and overhead was reduced.
- The company achieved better scalability and easier management of its databases.

## **10.4 Case Study 3: Leveraging JSON Relational Duality in Oracle 23c**

### **10.4.1 Scenario**
- **Problem:** A modern application requires flexibility in data modeling, needing both relational and JSON interfaces for the same data.
- **Challenges:**
  - Integrating JSON data with existing relational data.
  - Ensuring consistency between relational and JSON representations.
  - Optimizing performance for both transactional and analytical workloads.

### **10.4.2 Solution**
1. **Creating a Duality View:**
   - Create a relational table:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employees (
         emp_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
         emp_name VARCHAR2(100),
         emp_salary NUMBER
     );
     ```
   - Create a duality view:
     ```sql
     CREATE JSON DUALITY VIEW employee_json AS
     SELECT JSON {
         'empId': emp_id,
         'empName': emp_name,
         'empSalary': emp_salary
     }
     FROM employees;
     ```

2. **Querying and Updating Data:**
   - Query JSON data:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employee_json
     WHERE JSON_EXISTS(data, '$.empName');
     ```
   - Update JSON data:
     ```sql
     UPDATE employee_json
     SET data = JSON_MERGEPATCH(data, '{"empSalary": 5000}')
     WHERE JSON_VALUE(data, '$.empId') = 1;
     ```

3. **Ensuring Consistency:**
   - Use triggers or constraints to ensure consistency between relational and JSON representations.
   - Monitor performance and optimize as needed.

### **10.4.3 Outcome**
- The application gained flexibility in data modeling, supporting both relational and JSON interfaces.
- Data consistency was maintained between the two representations.
- Performance was optimized for both transactional and analytical workloads.
