# **Chapter 3: Oracle Database 11g - The Foundation of Modern Features**

---

## **3.1 Overview of Oracle Database 11g**

Oracle Database 11g, released in 2007, was a significant milestone in Oracle's history. It introduced several features that laid the groundwork for modern database administration, including **Real Application Testing (RAT)**, **Advanced Compression**, and **Edition-Based Redefinition (EBR)**. These features improved performance, scalability, and manageability, making Oracle Database 11g a popular choice for enterprise environments.

## **3.2 Key Features of Oracle Database 11g**

### **3.2.1 Real Application Testing (RAT)**
- **Purpose:** Allows DBAs to test system changes (e.g., upgrades, patches, hardware changes) in a production-like environment.
- **Components:**
  - **Database Replay:** Captures and replays real production workloads.
  - **SQL Performance Analyzer (SPA):** Analyzes the impact of changes on SQL performance.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces the risk of performance regressions during upgrades.
  - Provides a safe way to test changes before applying them to production.

### **3.2.2 Advanced Compression**
- **Purpose:** Reduces storage costs and improves performance by compressing data at the block level.
- **Types of Compression:**
  - **Basic Table Compression:** Compresses data during bulk loads.
  - **Advanced Row Compression:** Compresses data during both bulk loads and DML operations.
  - **Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC):** Provides high compression ratios for data warehousing workloads.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces storage requirements by up to 80%.
  - Improves query performance by reducing I/O.

### **3.2.3 Edition-Based Redefinition (EBR)**
- **Purpose:** Enables online application upgrades with minimal downtime.
- **How It Works:**
  - Multiple versions of database objects (e.g., tables, views, PL/SQL code) can coexist in different editions.
  - Applications can switch to the new edition once the upgrade is complete.
- **Benefits:**
  - Eliminates downtime during application upgrades.
  - Simplifies rollback in case of issues.

### **3.2.4 Other Notable Features**
- **Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR):**
  - Centralized storage for diagnostic data (e.g., traces, logs, dumps).
  - Simplifies troubleshooting and problem resolution.
- **Flashback Data Archive:**
  - Tracks all changes to data over time.
  - Enables historical querying and auditing.
- **Result Cache:**
  - Caches the results of frequently executed queries.
  - Improves performance for repetitive queries.

## **3.3 Hands-On: Implementing Advanced Compression**

### **3.3.1 Enabling Basic Table Compression**
1. **Create a Table with Compression:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE sales_compressed (
       sale_id NUMBER,
       sale_date DATE,
       amount NUMBER
   ) COMPRESS FOR OLTP;
   ```

2. **Verify Compression:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, compression, compress_for
   FROM user_tables
   WHERE table_name = 'SALES_COMPRESSED';
   ```

### **3.3.2 Enabling Advanced Row Compression**
1. **Alter an Existing Table:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE sales_compressed COMPRESS FOR OLTP;
   ```

2. **Verify Compression:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, compression, compress_for
   FROM user_tables
   WHERE table_name = 'SALES_COMPRESSED';
   ```

### **3.3.3 Enabling Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC)**
1. **Create a Table with HCC:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE sales_hcc (
       sale_id NUMBER,
       sale_date DATE,
       amount NUMBER
   ) COMPRESS FOR QUERY HIGH;
   ```

2. **Verify Compression:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, compression, compress_for
   FROM user_tables
   WHERE table_name = 'SALES_HCC';
   ```

## **3.4 Hands-On: Using Real Application Testing (RAT)**

### **3.4.1 Capturing a Workload**
1. **Start Workload Capture:**
   ```sql
   BEGIN
       DBMS_WORKLOAD_CAPTURE.START_CAPTURE(
           name => 'CAPTURE_1',
           dir => 'CAPTURE_DIR'
       );
   END;
   ```

2. **Simulate a Workload:**
   - Run typical SQL queries and DML operations on the database.

3. **Stop Workload Capture:**
   ```sql
   BEGIN
       DBMS_WORKLOAD_CAPTURE.FINISH_CAPTURE();
   END;
   ```

### **3.4.2 Replaying a Workload**
1. **Start Workload Replay:**
   ```sql
   BEGIN
       DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPLAY.INITIALIZE_REPLAY(
           replay_name => 'REPLAY_1',
           replay_dir => 'REPLAY_DIR'
       );
   END;
   ```

2. **Replay the Workload:**
   ```sql
   BEGIN
       DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPLAY.START_REPLAY();
   END;
   ```

3. **Analyze the Results:**
   - Use the **SQL Performance Analyzer (SPA)** to compare performance before and after changes.

## **3.5 Hands-On: Implementing Edition-Based Redefinition (EBR)**

### **3.5.1 Creating Editions**
1. **Create a New Edition:**
   ```sql
   CREATE EDITION upgrade_edition;
   ```

2. **Set the Session Edition:**
   ```sql
   ALTER SESSION SET edition = upgrade_edition;
   ```

### **3.5.2 Upgrading Objects in the New Edition**
1. **Create a New Version of a Procedure:**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE process_sales AS
   BEGIN
       -- New implementation
   END;
   ```

2. **Verify the New Version:**
   ```sql
   SELECT object_name, edition_name
   FROM user_objects
   WHERE object_name = 'PROCESS_SALES';
   ```

### **3.5.3 Switching to the New Edition**
1. **Set the Database Edition:**
   ```sql
   ALTER DATABASE DEFAULT EDITION = upgrade_edition;
   ```

2. **Verify the Switch:**
   ```sql
   SELECT property_value
   FROM database_properties
   WHERE property_name = 'DEFAULT_EDITION';
   ```
